# MyReads Project
The MyReads project is a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorise books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

The project emphasises using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library
that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

## How to run
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
